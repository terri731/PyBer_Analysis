# PyBer_Analysis
##### This project uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib
## Overview
##### Analyze ride share data by city type. Calculate average fare by city type. Also, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type
## Results
##### Rural cities brought in the highest average fares per driver, while Urban cities brought in the lowest fares per driver. This is directly related to the number of people in each city type. Because there are not as many people in rural cities, there are also not as many Pyber drivers and therefore they will bring in less money.

## Summary
##### Based on the summary below, PyBer will make more money if they recruit more drivers in the suburbs as well as the rural cities. I would also steadily increase drivers in urban areas as well to continue the trend and try to stay ahead of the competition.
